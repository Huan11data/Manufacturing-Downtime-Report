# Manufacturing-Downtime-Report
## Objective
This analysis was conducted at the request of senior leadership to evaluate operator downtime and production efficiency across manufacturing operations. 
Key objectives included:

Identify and compare individual technician efficiency metrics to pinpoint performance gaps.
   
Determine root causes of downtime delays and quantify their impact on productivity.
   
Assess whether downtime increases stem from operational errors or machine malfunctions to guide corrective actions.
## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, a reputable data science platform, and included records of downtime events, operator performance, and machine logs.
## Methodology
## Data Cleaning:

o	Removed duplicates and addressed missing/null values.

## Data Analysis:

o	Performed calculations using advanced lookup functions (VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) to merge and analyze cross-referenced datasets.

o	Categorized downtime causes and quantified their frequency and duration.

o	Calculated operator efficiency metrics using downtime-to-production ratios.

## Visualizations & Findings

## Operator Efficiency Bar Chart:

o	Highlights disparities in performance, with Technician Mac ranking lowest (61% efficiency vs. team average of 63.75%).

## Downtime Contributing Factors Column Chart:

o	Top 5 factors (e.g., machine adjustment, machine failures) account for 80% of total downtime.

## Downtime Cause Matrix:

o	Correlates specific operators with recurring issues (e.g., Macâ€™s frequent delays during batch changes).

## Key Insights
## Performance Improvement Opportunity:

o	Technician Mac demonstrates the lowest efficiency (61%). Recommended focus: Targeted training on batch changeover protocols to reduce setup time.

## Prioritized Downtime Drivers:

o	Addressing the top 5 factors (machine adjustment, machine failure, inventory shortage, batch change and batch coding error) could reduce downtime. Secondary factors show marginal impact.

## Root Cause Analysis:

o	3 of the highest downtime incidents stem from operator-related errors, underscoring the need for specialized training programs (machine adjustment, and batch change).

## Recommendations

1. Implement skill-specific training for technicians, prioritizing batch changeover efficiency.

2. Develop standardized operating procedures (SOPs) for the top 5 downtime drivers.

3. Introduce real-time downtime tracking to enable proactive interventions.
   
## Conclusion

This analysis identifies actionable pathways to reduce downtime through targeted training and process optimization. Further review of machine maintenance logs is recommended to isolate equipment-related inefficiencies.
